# @comity/customer

Customer domain abstractions for Comity modules.

---

## Purpose

Defines the customer domain model — the `Customer` entity, the `CustomerId` value object, and the contracts modules use to store, load, and validate customers. Provides a stable domain boundary so application logic depends on contracts rather than infrastructure.

---

## Scope

This package:

- ✅ defines the `Customer` entity and `CustomerId` value object
- ✅ defines the `CustomerRepository` contract
- ✅ defines the `CustomerValidator` contract
- ✅ defines customer data, state, snapshot, create, and update types
- ✅ depends only on `@comity/primitives` and `@comity/validation`

This package does NOT:

- ❌ provide a repository implementation
- ❌ provide validation logic
- ❌ depend on infrastructure or adapters

---

## Public API
