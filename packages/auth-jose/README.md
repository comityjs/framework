# @comity/auth-jose

JOSE token service and setup for Comity authentication.

---

## Purpose

Provides a JOSE-backed token service that implements the auth token contracts defined by `@comity/auth`. Wires the token service into the Comity module system through setup types and module hooks.

---

## Scope

This package:

- ✅ provides JOSE token creation and verification
- ✅ exposes setup types for module wiring
- ✅ offers module-level hooks for configuring authentication

This package does NOT:

- ❌ define authentication domain logic
- ❌ manage session lifecycle or assurance evaluation
- ❌ implement transport-level token handling

---

## Public API
