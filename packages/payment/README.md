# @comity/payment

Payment domain abstractions for Comity.

---

## Purpose

Defines the payment domain contracts: payment requests, outcomes, provider interfaces, and module setup. Provides the foundation for integrating payment providers without binding to specific payment gateways.

---

## Scope

This package:

- ✅ defines `PaymentRequest`, `PaymentOutcome`, `PaymentStatus` contracts
- ✅ exposes the `PaymentProvider` contract for payment execution
- ✅ provides domain error types for payment failures
- ✅ supplies module setup tokens and metadata for kernel integration

This package does NOT:

- ❌ implement specific payment gateways (Stripe, Adyen, etc.)
- ❌ manage payment method storage or tokenization
- ❌ handle refunds, disputes, or reconciliation
- ❌ encode business rules for payment flows
