# @comity/geography

Geographic metadata and rules independent from address storage.

---

## Purpose

Provides geographic knowledge — country and subdivision metadata — that enriches and interprets geographic identifiers stored elsewhere. An address stores identifiers; geography interprets them.

---

## Scope

This package:

- ✅ defines the `GeographyProvider` contract
- ✅ defines `CountryMetadata` and `SubdivisionMetadata` types
- ✅ defines geographic context and input types
- ✅ depends only on `@comity/primitives`

This package does NOT:

- ❌ store addresses or geographic identifiers
- ❌ provide a provider implementation
- ❌ validate postal codes or other address fields

---

## Public API

- `GeographyProvider` — provider contract for resolving geographic metadata
- `CountryMetadata` / `SubdivisionMetadata` — resolved metadata types
- `GeographicInput` / `GeographicContext` — resolution input and context types
- Error types (`@comity/geography/errors`)

No exhaustive reference; see docs for constraints.
