# @comity/auth

Authentication and session domain core for the Comity platform.

---

## Purpose

`@comity/auth` provides the **domain and application logic** for authentication,
session lifecycle management, and assurance evaluation.

It is designed as a pure, framework-independent module that can be integrated
with different transport mechanisms (HTTP, tokens, RPC).

---

## Scope

This package:

- ✅ defines the authentication domain (sessions, assurance, refresh, step-up)
- ✅ provides use cases for session lifecycle management
- ✅ exposes a unified `AuthFacade`
- ✅ emits domain events for observability and integration

This package does NOT:

- ❌ parse or validate HTTP requests
- ❌ issue or verify tokens directly
- ❌ manage persistence details
- ❌ depend on any transport or framework

---

## Public API

- Policy contracts — assurance, refresh, and revocation policy interfaces
- Domain events — session lifecycle event interfaces
- Errors — authorization error types (`@comity/auth/errors`)
- Observers — passive event subscribers (`@comity/auth/observers`)
- Policies — canonical policy implementations (`@comity/auth/policies`)
- Setup — kernel module metadata and wiring (`@comity/auth/setup`)
- Use cases — session lifecycle operations (`@comity/auth/use-cases`)
