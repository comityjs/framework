/**
 * Reasons for authentication errors.
 *
 * @remarks
 * These reasons are used to categorize different types of authentication failures.
 *
 * - `session_invalid`: The session object violates structural domain invariants. Use only for internal model validation failures.
 * - `session_expired`: The session has expired according to its expiration timestamp.
 * - `session_revoked`: The session has been explicitly revoked by policy or storage.
 * - `session_not_found`: The session was not found in the repository.
 * - `refresh_expired`: The refresh window has expired and refresh is no longer possible.
 * - `refresh_not_allowed`: Refresh is not allowed by policy (e.g. disabled or age limit exceeded).
 * - `refresh_required`: A refresh is required to continue.
 * - `assurance_required`: An assurance evaluation is required but not present.
 * - `assurance_invalid`: The assurance object is structurally invalid or inconsistent. Do NOT use for policy failures.
 * - `assurance_expired`: The assurance evaluation is too old and no longer valid.
 * - `assurance_context_mismatch`: The assurance context does not satisfy required bounds.
 * - `assurance_step_up_required`: A step-up verification is required before continuing.
 * - `assurance_too_low`: The assurance score is below the required threshold.
 * - `token_invalid`: The provided token is malformed, invalid or cannot be verified.
 * - `token_expired`: The provided token has expired.
 * - `authentication_required`: No valid authentication credentials were provided.
 * - `forbidden`: The authenticated subject is not allowed to access the resource.
 * - `invalid_credentials`: The provided credentials are incorrect.
 * - `conflict`: The request conflicts with the current authentication state.

/**
 * Authentication error metadata violations.
 *
 * @remarks
 * These violations provide specific details about why a session is considered invalid.
 * They are used as metadata in `AuthError` instances when the reason is `session_invalid`.
 * They should NOT be used for policy-level errors, which should use specific reasons instead.
 *
 * - `session_id_missing`: The session ID is missing or not a valid string.
 * - `created_at_invalid`: The session's `createdAt` timestamp is missing, not a number, or in the future.
 * - `verified_at_invalid`: The session's `verifiedAt` timestamp is before `createdAt`.
 * - `revoked_at_invalid`: The session's `revokedAt` timestamp is before `createdAt`.
 * - `expires_at_invalid`: The session's `expiresAt` timestamp is before or equal to `createdAt`.
 * - `assurance_missing`: The session's assurance object is missing or not an object.
 * - `assurance_methods_invalid`: The session's assurance methods are missing or not a non-empty array.
 * - `assurance_proof_invalid`: The session's assurance proof is invalid (e.g. missing when required).
 * - `assurance_score_invalid`: The session's assurance score is invalid (e.g. not a number or out of range).
 * - `assurance_evaluated_at_invalid`: The session's assurance evaluatedAt timestamp is invalid (e.g. not a number or in the future).
 * - `assurance_version_invalid`: The session's assurance version is invalid (e.g. not a number).
 * - `assurance_context_invalid`: The session's assurance context is invalid (e.g. not an object).
 * - `session_transport_invalid`: The session's transport mechanism is invalid or unsupported.
 * - `refresh_enabled_invalid`: The session's refresh configuration is invalid (e.g. enabled but missing parameters).
 * - `refresh_expires_at_invalid`: The session's refresh expiration timestamp is invalid (e.g. not a number or in the past).
 * - `step_up_parent_invalid`: The session's step-up parent reference is invalid (e.g. missing or not a valid session ID).
 * - `step_up_at_invalid`: The session's step-up timestamp is invalid (e.g. not a number or in the future).
