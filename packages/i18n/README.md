# @comity/i18n

Internationalization module for Comity.

---

## Purpose

Defines locale, translation, and loader contracts for Comity-based applications. Exposes a facade for consuming translations and includes setup types for module wiring.

---

## Scope

This package:

- ✅ defines locale and translator contracts
- ✅ provides an I18n facade for application consumption
- ✅ exposes the `error` and `setup` subpaths
- ✅ offers module-level hooks for configuring translations

This package does NOT:

- ❌ implement translation data storage
- ❌ provide typed translation bridges
- ❌ own application-specific localization policy
