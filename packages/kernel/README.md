# @comity/kernel

Runtime orchestrator for Comity applications.

---

## Purpose

Provides a minimal orchestration layer that coordinates module lifecycle, service registration, and event/hook signaling without imposing a framework or runtime model. The kernel is optional.

---

## Scope

This package:

- ✅ manages application lifecycle and initialization
- ✅ coordinates module setup and shared context
- ✅ exposes lifecycle events (observable) and hook execution (participatory)

This package does NOT:

- ❌ perform UI rendering or transport concerns
- ❌ manage HTTP or external protocols
- ❌ encode application or domain policies

---

## Public API

- Kernel — orchestrator with lifecycle control and context
- Module — metadata, resolver, and loader contracts
