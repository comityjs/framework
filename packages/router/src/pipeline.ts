/**
 * RouterPipeline is a composite router that allows you to chain multiple routers and URL rewriters together. It implements the Router interface, enabling it to be used wherever a Router is expected. The pipeline processes incoming HTTP requests by first applying any registered URL rewriters to modify the request URL as needed, and then sequentially invoking each router in the order they were added until a match is found or all routers have been exhausted.
 *
 * @remarks
 * - The RouterPipeline does not enforce any specific order of routers or rewriters; it simply processes them in the order they were provided.
 * - URL rewriters are applied before route matching, allowing them to influence which routes are matched for a given request.
 * - If multiple routers are registered, the pipeline will return the first successful match it finds. If no routers match the request, it will return null.
 * - This design allows for flexible routing configurations, enabling developers to compose complex routing logic from simpler, modular components.
