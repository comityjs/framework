# @comity/http

HTTP module for Comity framework applications.

---

## Purpose

Provides a transport-agnostic HTTP pipeline with middleware, lifecycle events, and explicit response handling. It defines contracts for adapters and facades without binding to any specific server/runtime or transport implementation.

---

## Scope

This package:

- ✅ executes HTTP requests through an ordered middleware pipeline
- ✅ manages request-scoped context and state
- ✅ produces a structured HttpResult
- ✅ emits lifecycle events for observability

This package does NOT:

- ❌ bind to any HTTP server or runtime
- ❌ implement adapters (Hono, Fetch, etc.)
- ❌ perform rendering or serialization
- ❌ encode application business rules

---

## Public API

- Contracts — request, context, result, middleware, pipeline, transport
- Facade — lifecycle-aware orchestrator that executes the pipeline
- Lifecycle — request lifecycle events (`@comity/http/observers`)
- Error types (`@comity/http/errors`)
- Setup — kernel module metadata and setup function (`@comity/http/setup`)

No exhaustive reference; see docs for constraints.
