# SKILL.md — Comity Framework

## Purpose

Comity is an enterprise-grade, modular TypeScript framework built around strict architectural layering. The monorepo contains 51 runtime packages organized by architectural responsibility.

The primary goal is long-term maintainability through:

- **Explicit boundaries** — every piece of code belongs to a single architectural layer
- **Replaceable infrastructure** — any adapter can be swapped without touching business logic
- **Strong contracts** — Core Modules define stable interfaces; Adapters implement them
- **Composition over inheritance** — objects are assembled through small composable units
- **Framework independence** — Core Modules never import framework-specific types

Every change must reinforce these principles rather than simply implementing features.

## Architecture

### Layering Model

Dependencies flow **only downward**. Reverse dependencies are architectural defects.

```
Application
      ↓
Adapters
      ↓
Core Modules
      ↓
Kernel / Primitives
```

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer            | Responsibility                                                              | Key Rule                                                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Primitives**   | Foundational types, `Result`, DI container, error base class                | No runtime state, no infrastructure, no business logic                |
| **Kernel**       | Module lifecycle, service registration, event dispatching, observers | No HTTP, no Router, no HTML, no infrastructure                         |
| **Core Modules** | Business abstractions. Primarily define contracts (interfaces); may also ship canonical domain implementations (e.g. `Default*` composers, `Memory*` test doubles, transport-independent client facades) | Must not depend on Adapters or Application                            |
| **Adapters**     | Integrate external technologies (Hono, React, Kysely, Preact, Jose, etc.)   | Implement one Core contract (+ external library); may consume additional Core contracts without implementing them. Must remain replaceable |
| **Application**  | Configuration, routing, presenters, business orchestration                  | May depend on every lower layer                                       |

### Package Identification

| Type              | Dependencies                                       | Has external lib? | Has `contracts/` folder? |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------ |
| Core Module       | Only `@comity/*` (primitives, kernel, other cores) | No                | Yes                      |
| Adapter           | Core Module(s) + external library (peerDependency) | Yes               | Rarely                   |
| Kernel/Primitives | Nothing or only `@comity/primitives`               | No                | Sometimes                |

### Key Design Principles

- **Contracts vs Implementations** — `CategoryRepository` lives in Core; `MagentoGraphqlCategoryRepository` lives in an Adapter
- **Repositories return domain models** — never view models, page models, React components, or HTML
- **Renderers consume PageModels** — never query repositories themselves
- **Lazy registration** — prefer `ctx.services.define(TOKEN, () => impl)` over eager construction
- **Configuration precedence** — `defaults → user options → configuring hook`; never modify config after initialization

## Conventions

### Folder Naming

| Element   | Form     | Example          |
| --------- | -------- | ---------------- |
| Errors    | Plural   | `src/errors/`    |
| Contracts | Plural   | `src/contracts/` |
| Observers | Plural   | `src/observers/` |
| Setup     | Singular | `src/setup/`     |

### Folder Structure (Standard Package)

```
packages/<name>/
├── src/
│   ├── contracts/      # Interfaces (Core Modules only)
│   ├── errors/           # Custom error types
│   ├── observers/           # Lifecycle observers
│   ├── setup/           # Constants, types, configuration
│   ├── internal/        # Package-internal code (never exported in package.json)
│   ├── __tests__/       # Co-located tests
│   └── index.ts         # Public API barrel export
├── docs/
│   ├── overview.md       # High-level description and API
│   └── conventions.md    # Package-specific conventions
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
├── vitest.config.ts
└── README.md
```

### Code Style

**Prefer**: immutable data, pure functions, dependency injection, small interfaces, explicit contracts.
**Avoid**: static state, hidden globals, service locators outside composition, unnecessary inheritance, framework-specific types in Core Modules.

ESLint enforces layered rules (see `docs/architecture/repository.md` for details).

### Documentation

Every package MUST document its public API with JSDoc. ESLint requires `@description` on public declarations, `@param` and `@returns` on functions.

## Workflow

### Development Commands

| Command                          | Purpose                                                   |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`                   | Install dependencies (pnpm only, enforced via preinstall) |
| `pnpm dev`                       | Watch mode across all packages                            |
| `pnpm build`                     | Full build via Turborepo (workspace scope; drafts excluded)          |
| `pnpm build:single @comity/http` | Build a single package and its deps                       |
| `pnpm type-check`                | TypeScript type checking across all packages              |
| `pnpm test`                      | Run all tests (Vitest workspace mode)                     |
| `pnpm test:watch`                | Watch mode for tests                                      |
| `pnpm test:coverage`             | Run tests and emit coverage report (per-package thresholds may apply) |
| `pnpm changeset`                 | Create a versioning changeset                             |

### Build Pipeline

Turborepo (`turbo.json`) coordinates builds:

- `build` tasks depends on `^build` (build dependencies first)
- Cache enabled for builds, tracked by `src/**/*.ts` + `tsconfig.json` + `package.json`
- Output: `dist/` with dual ESM/CJS bundles

### Testing

Vitest workspace mode: each package declares its own `vitest.config.ts`. Root config sets:

- Environment: `node`
- Coverage thresholds: not enforced at the root config; per-package vitest configs MAY declare thresholds
- Timeout: 10s

### Key Patterns

**Error Handling** — Never throw in Core Modules or domain code. Always use `Result<T, E>` from `@comity/primitives`:

```typescript
// Success
const result = Result.success({ userId: "123" });
// Failure
const result = Result.failure(new AuthError("session-expired"));
```

**Dependency Injection** — Use tokens and lazy registration:

```typescript
const TOKEN = createToken<MyRepository>("@comity/catalog/my-repo");
ctx.services.define(TOKEN, () => new Implementation());
```

**Lifecycle Hooks** — `@comity/module:configuring` (modify config), `@comity/module:initialized` (signals ready).

## Decision Process

### When Making a Change

Follow this sequence:

1. **Identify the owning package** — which existing package is responsible for this concern? If unsure, consult `docs/architecture/repository.md`.
2. **Verify the architectural layer** — does this change belong in the Core Module, Adapter, or Application?
3. **Reuse existing abstractions** — is there already a contract, type, or utility that handles this? Do not create duplicates.
4. **Prefer extending contracts over creating parallel APIs** — enlarge existing interfaces rather than introducing new ones.
5. **Avoid introducing new dependencies** — every new dependency is a coupling point. Justify it.
6. **Preserve public API compatibility** — existing subpath exports, function signatures, and type names should remain stable unless explicitly requested.
7. **Keep documentation aligned with implementation** — if you change a contract, update its JSDoc and the package's `docs/overview.md`.

### Never

- **Move responsibilities between packages** without explicit request — each package owns its domain
- **Introduce new architectural layers** — the 5-layer model is the framework
- **Rename public exports** — even if it seems redundant, it breaks downstream consumers
- **Change dependency direction** — a Core Module should never import an Adapter
- **Create new abstractions unless existing ones are insufficient** — an abstraction do not need to exist for its own sake

## Contributing

### New Package Checklist

1. Create `packages/<name>/src/index.ts`
2. Add standard folders: `contracts/` (Core only) or `errors/`, `setup/`, `observers/` as appropriate
3. Create `package.json` with workspace dependencies
4. Add `tsconfig.json`, `vitest.config.ts`, `README.md`, `LICENSE`
5. Create `docs/overview.md` and `docs/conventions.md`
6. Register in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` under `packages/`

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] **Layering respected** — dependencies flow down, no reverse imports
- [ ] **Contracts stable** — no breaking changes to existing contract types
- [ ] **Public API mapped** — `package.json` subpath exports mirror physical folders
- [ ] **Folder naming correct** — `errors/` not `error/`, `contracts/` not `contract/`, etc.
- [ ] **No framework types leaked into Core Modules** — Core Modules are framework-independent
- [ ] **Internal/ not exported** — nothing in `src/internal/` appears in `package.json` exports
- [ ] **Tests cover behavior** — follow the owning package's declared coverage thresholds
- [ ] **Documentation updated** — JSDoc on public methods, `docs/` folder updated
- [ ] **No throw in domain/core** — use `Result<T, E>` for all failures
- [ ] **No secrets commited** — `.npmrc`, `.env`, credentials excluded

| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Start from "who owns this responsibility?" | Start from "where can I put this?"                     |
| Define contracts in Core Modules           | Put technology-specific implementations in Core Modules    |
| Expose only the minimum public API         | Create convenience short cuts that leak implementation |
| Register services lazily                   | Construct eagerly                                      |
| Use `Result<T, E>` for failures            | Throw for business logic                               |
| Preserve folder naming conventions         | Use singular `error/`/`hooks/` — the conventions are `errors/`, `observers/`, `contracts/` (plural) and `setup/` (singular) |
| Align exports with physical folders        | Export subpaths for non-existent directories           |
| Justify every abstraction                  | Create abstraction "just in case"                      |
